- Nasir Uddin


This repo contain implementation of AWS SageMaker Demo for XGboost.
- Demo content: As a machine learning developer for the marketing department of a bank you need to predict if a customer will enroll for certificate of deposit. Your marketing dataset contains bank information on customer demographics, response to marketing events, and external environment factors. The data is labeled, meaning there is a column in the dataset that identifies whether the customer is enrolled for a product offered by the bank. For this example scenario, you will use a publicly-available dataset from the ML repository curated by the University of California, Irvine.
